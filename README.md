# My data analysis on 'Cyclistic', a fictional bike-sharing company.
## Introduction
This project is my submission for Study Case 1 on **[Google Data Analytics Professional Certficate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) - Capstone Project**.
## Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
## Data Analysis Process
In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: _ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act_.
### Phase 1 - Ask
Based on above scenario, I started this project by asking the stakeholder about the project goals. This phase will give me clear understanding about the business tasks, and stay focus on the project goals when applying next step on every phase of data analysis process. This phase will also help me to decide: what data should I get, and how to perform analysis on this kind of data.

Three questions arose after applied this phase:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
### Phase 2 - Prepare
For the purposes of this case study, I will use [Divvy’s historical trip data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), and download the last 12 months of trip data to analyze and identify trends. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). Because Cyclistic is a fictional company, I will use this public data to explore how different customer types are using their bikes. However, data-privacy issues prohibit me from using rider's personally identifiable information, so I won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the company service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.

This data is stored on my google drive, I kept the original version of this data in order to use it for future reference.
